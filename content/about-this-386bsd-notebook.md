Summary: This blog's about my 386bsd "stuff" - past, present, future.

I've been putting all my 386bsd archives into github as "work in progress" project. It'll take some time, as it's dozens of drives, cdrom's and hundreds of floppies. I'd like to say it's all nicely, chronologically ordered, but ... boxes of loose materials in an idiosyncratic form. So I'm just throwing it up and integrating it into the github repo as I make sense of things, as I've time.

This is a *"notebook"* of things as I do this, an amalgum of memories, findings, debugging, opinion, observation, and retrospection.

**A big thank you to fans/users of 386bsd, my coauthor Lynne, son Benjamin, and daughter Rebecca who have encouraged me to accomplish this.**
